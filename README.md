# Valkyrie

As the Valkyries' whispers guide us, we carve our path to a Valhalla of optimized Minecraft gameplay.

Valkyrie is a mod designed to optimize client-side operations while simultaneously introducing some valuable features.

Though currently in its beta stage, rest assured that Valkyrie remains fully stable. The 'beta' label simply reflects our ongoing commitment to continual improvement and optimization, we're not done enhancing its capabilities just yet!

We greatly value your feedback and ideas. If you notice anything missing or have specific optimizations in mind that you'd like us to incorporate, don't hesitate to reach out. You can share your suggestions or report issues on our GitHub page or join the conversation on our Discord server.

## Performance Enhancements

- Faster cloud rendering
- Faster MathHelper
- Slightly faster ModelRenderer

## Features

- **Configurable Zoom:** Zoom in with precision or pan out for a broader view with Valkyrie's flexible and user-friendly zoom functionality.
- **Bigger Atlas:** Valkyrie allows you to have a texture atlas as big as your GPU really supports.
- **Colored Clouds:** Experience the ethereal beauty of clouds tinted by the rising and setting sun with Valkyrie's Colored Clouds feature.
- **Independent Clouds Render Distance:** Gain the power to customize your clouds' render distance independently, enabling them to extend beyond the terrain render distance.
- **Modern Icons & Logo:** By default Valkyrie changes the main menu logo to the newer one as well as the window icon
- **Window Customization:** Personalize your Minecraft window title and icon with Valkyrie, a handy feature for modpack developers.
- **Bug Fixes:** Beyond enhancing performance and aesthetics, Valkyrie also addresses Minecraft bugs such as [MC-67532](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-67532).
- **Old Java Detection:** Valkyrie will scan which Java version are you using and warn you if it's outdated as well as if you are using 32 Bit Java.
